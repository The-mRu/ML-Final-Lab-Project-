## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and go to the application URL
2. **Navigate to Prediction Page**: Click on "Predict" in the navigation menu
3. **Enter Patient Data**: Fill in all required health parameters
4. **Get Prediction**: Click "Calculate Risk" to see the prediction results
5. **Interpret Results**: 
   - ✅ Green checkmark = No liver disease detected
   - ⚠️ Red warning triangle = Liver disease detected

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for local development:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
```

### Model Training (Optional)

If you want to retrain the model:

1. The original training code is based on the Indian Liver Patient Dataset
2. The model uses SVM with RBF kernel (C=10, gamma=0.1)
3. Dataset is balanced using SMOTE technique
4. Features are standardized using StandardScaler

<!-- ## 🌐 Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on Render.com. See the `render.yaml` and `build.sh` files for deployment configuration. -->
